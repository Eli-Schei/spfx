# SPfx Repo
I use this repo to play around with SPfx. Containes some finished, and some only half finished webpart samples and POCs.

## React Sticky Notes (work in progress)
Webpart that displays list items as sticky notes. You can drag'n'drop them to change their position. 

## Simple RSS Webpart (POC - do not plan to finish this one)
You can add a header, URL to the RSS feed, maximum articles to be displayed, and select it the articles should be displayed as Cards or Items
